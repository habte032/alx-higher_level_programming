## Python: Importing and Using Modules

This project covers concepts related to importing and using functions, creating modules, and working with command-line arguments in Python. You'll also explore using the `dir()` function and delve into various functionalities.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Importing and utilizing functions from modules
* Creating your own modules in Python
* Employing the `dir()` function
* Working effectively with command-line arguments

**Tasks:**

**1. Import a Simple Function (0-add.py)**

Practice importing a function from another file (`add_0.py`) and using it to perform addition (0-add.py).

**2. My First Toolbox (1-calculation.py)**

Create a program (1-calculation.py) that imports functions from a module (`calculator_1.py`) to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on provided values.

**3. How to Make a Script Dynamic! (2-args.py)**

Develop a script (2-args.py) that displays the number of arguments it receives and a list of those arguments.

**4. Infinite Addition (3-infinite_add.py)**

Write a program (3-infinite_add.py) that calculates and prints the sum of all its command-line arguments.

**5. Variable Import (5-variable_load.py)**

Create a program (5-variable_load.py) that imports a variable (`a`) from another file (`variable_load_5.py`) and prints its value.

**6. Build a Calculator (100-my_calculator.py)**

Implement a basic calculator program (100-my_calculator.py) that imports functions from a module (`calculator_1.py`) to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. Handle errors for invalid operators or argument count.

**7. Easy Print (101-easy_print.py)**

Write a program (101-easy_print.py) that prints "#pythoniscool" without using standard printing functions, `eval`, `open`, or `sys`.

**8. Bytecode Challenge (102-magic_calculation.py)**

This task involves creating a Python function that matches a specific bytecode provided by Holberton School.

**9. Fast Alphabet (103-fast_alphabet.py)**

Develop a program that prints the uppercase alphabet in a single line without using loops, conditionals, `str.join()`, string literals, or system calls.

This project provides a hands-on experience with various functionalities in Python. Feel free to explore further and experiment with more complex modules and functionalities.
